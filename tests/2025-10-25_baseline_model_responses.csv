I'm here to help. Losing a job can be tough, but there's support available. Let me explain how unemployment insurance works in California and some tips to maximize your benefits.

**What is Unemployment Insurance?**
Unemployment insurance is a program that helps people who lost their job through no fault of their own. It provides temporary financial support while you're looking for a new job.

**How Does it Work?**

1. **Eligibility**: You must have worked and earned enough money in the past 12-18 months to qualify. You also need to be actively looking for a new job and available to start work immediately.
2. **Filing a Claim**: You'll need to file a claim with the California Employment Development Department (EDD). You can do this online, by phone, or in person.
3. **Weekly Benefits**: If your claim is approved, you'll receive a weekly benefit amount based on your past earnings. This amount can range from $40 to $450 per week.
4. **Duration**: You can receive benefits for up to 26 weeks, but this can vary depending on the state's unemployment rate.

**Tips to Maximize Your Benefits**

1. **File Your Claim ASAP**: The sooner you file, the sooner you'll start receiving benefits.
2. **Be Available and Actively Looking**: Make sure you're available to start work immediately and actively looking for a new job. This can include applying to jobs, attending interviews, and networking.
3. **Certify Your Eligibility**: Every two weeks, you'll need to certify that you're still eligible for benefits. Make sure to do this on time to avoid delays.
4. **Report Any Earnings**: If you earn money while receiving benefits, report it to the EDD. This will help you avoid overpayment and potential penalties.
5. **Take Advantage of Job Search Resources**: The EDD offers free job search resources, such as resume building and interview prep. Take advantage of these to help you find a new job faster.

**Additional Resources**

- **Other programs** – things like CalFresh (food stamps), Medi‑Cal (health care), CalWORKs (cash help for families), and the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC).  

You can receive UI **and** any of those other programs together, as long as you meet each program’s rules.  

**Things to remember**

1. **Tell each program you’re applying for.** When you apply for CalFresh or Medi‑Cal, say you are also getting UI.  
2. **Report your income.** All programs want to know how much money you’re getting, so they can decide how much help you need.  
3. **Some limits exist.** A few programs may reduce the amount you get if you already receive a lot of money from another source.  

**What to do next**

- Call or go online to the agency for each program (EDD for UI, your local County Human Services Agency for CalFresh, etc.).  
- Ask a caseworker, “Can I get this program while I’m on unemployment?”  
- Keep a notebook of the dates you apply and the numbers you’re given.
